# focus_stack

Mac control of arduino based uStepper - see http://www.ustepper.com/index/ for focus stacking photography.
The hardware can be brought here http://ooznest.co.uk/3D-Printer-CNC-Kits-Bundles/C-Beam-Linear-Actuator.

The idea is to send commands to the Arduino serial port to control the system.
